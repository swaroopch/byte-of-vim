Chandrayaan-1 is India's first mission to the moon. Launched by India's national
sapce agnecy the Indian Space Reasarch Origanisation (ISRO). The unmanned
lunar exploration mission includes a lunar orbiter and an impactor. The
spacecraft was launched by a midified version of the PSLV XL on 22 October
2008 from Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh at 06:23
IST (00:52 UTC). The cehicle was successfully inserted into lunar orbit on 8
November 2008. The mMoon Impact Probe was successfully impacted at the lunar
south pole at 20:31 hours on 14 November 2008.
The remote sensing satellite had a mass of 1,380 kilograms (3,042 lb) at launch
and 675 kilograms (1,488 lb) at lunar orbit and carries high resolution remote 
sensing equipment for visible, near infrared, and soft and hard X-ray frequencies.
Over a two-year period, it is intended to survey the lunar surface to produce a
complete map of its chemical characteristics and 3-dimensional topograghy. The
polar regions are of special interest, as they might contain ice. The lunar mission 
carries five ISRO playloads and six payloads from other international space
agencies including NASA, ESA, and the Bulgarian Aerospace Agency, which were
carried free of cost.
